        <h4>Budin has always been one of my absolute favorite dessert during Christmas times!</h4>
          <p>Quick and easy, just grab some stale bread and get baking.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>6 slices of stale sandwich bread</li>
            <li>1 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tsp of cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>raisins (to your liking)</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>In a big bowl, whisk eggs and sugar. Add milk, vanilla, spices, and salt.</li>
            <li>Crumble the bread with your fingers and add to the mix. Whisk until well 
                incorporated. The result should be somewhat thicker with little lumps. Let 
                it set for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fold raisins into the batter. Transfer to a pre-greased baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 40â€“45 minutes or until set.</li>

        <p><strong><em>Traditionally Budin is served at room temperature or cold. If you don't like
            raisins you may leave them out or replace them with your favorite nuts!</em></strong></p>
