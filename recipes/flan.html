        <h4>This flan de queso is perfect for the holidays!</h4>

          <p>This recipe is super easy to make, all it does require
            is a bit of time, and patience.</p>
            
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/3 cup 2% milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, 
                cream cheese, milk, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place sugar in an even layer in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the edges 
                start to brown, about 1 minute; drag sugar into the center with a spatula once the
                edges start to brown. Continue cooking, stirring from time to time, until caramel 
                is an even golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, pour 1 inch boiling water into a large oven-safe pot or baking dish to 
                make a water bath.</li>
            <li>Pour caramel into a 9-inch flan mold or baking pan; swirl so that caramel 
                reaches 1 inch up the sides. Pour the condensed milk mixture on top. Set 
                in the water bath.</li>
            <li>Set the flan and water bath in the preheated oven; bake until a damp table knife 
                inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the 
                oven and let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Chill flan in the refrigerator until firm, 2 to 3 hours. Invert onto a serving 
                plate so that caramel is on top.</li>
          </ol>

        <p><strong><em>You'll need a flan mold or some sort of deep baking pan to make a typical
            flan!</em></strong></p>
