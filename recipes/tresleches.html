            <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>sprinkle ground cinnamon on top</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9Ã—13'' pan with non-stick 
                cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate 
                the eggs into two other mixing bowls.</li>
            <li>Add 3/4 cup sugar to the bowl with the egg yolks and mix on high 
                speed until yolks are pale yellow. Add 1/3 cup milk and vanilla 
                and stir to combine. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour 
                mixture and stir gently just until combined (don't over-mix).</li>
            <li>Use electric beaters to beat the egg whites on high speed. 
                As the begin to whip into stiff peaks, gradually mix in the 
                remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into 
                the batter gently, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl, until 
                combined.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth it into an even layer. 
                Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center 
                of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow cake to 
                cool completely.</li>
            <li>Combine the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and whole milk 
                in a small bowl. Once the cake has cooled use a fork to poke holes all 
                over the top of the cake. </li>
            <li>Slowly pour the milk mixture over the the top of the cake, making sure 
                to pour near the edges and all around. Refrigerate the cake for at least 
                1 hour or overnight, to allow it to soak up the milk.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, whip the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks. 
                Smooth over the top of the cake. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.</li>
